# COSC2429 – Introduction to Programming
## Assignment 1 – 2021C

Please submit a zip folder including 4 python files, 1 for each of these questions. They must
be named p1.py, p2.py, p3.py, and p4.py accordingly. No capital letter in the file names. There
will be automatic unit test, so if you don’t follow the naming and data type instruction
carefully, your programs might fail all the test cases.

Point deduction will be given if you:

- Have incorrect file names, function names, variable names
- Forget file header in the correct format
- Forget function docstrings in the correct format
- Have no or little code comment
- Writing too long and repetitive code where iteration can help shorten it

Note:

- Please don’t have any user input function
- Pay attention to data type of the outputs


## Problem 1:
Given a list of 20 integers, write a function to find the number in the list where exactly 80%
of numbers in the list are equal to or smaller than it (not including itself).

Your function takes the list of 20 integers as input and outputs the desired number.

IMPORTANT: Your function must be named and must have the function parameters listed in the same
order as below. (I will use a python script with a database to automatically test your function
so please don’t do it differently.)

```python
def find_split_80(integer_list):
# your logic here
# return the desired number
return split_80
```
